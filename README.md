# Captcha Solver with Deep Learning

This repository contains a complete Deep Learning project for recognizing 6-digit numerical CAPTCHAs. The project covers everything from data processing and visualization to building and deploying an API and a frontend for model inference.

## üîç Project Steps
1. **Data Processing and Visualization**: Using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore and understand the dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Creating and training a Deep Learning model with TensorFlow to recognize CAPTCHAs.
3. **API Deployment**: Building a FastAPI-based API to serve the trained model.
4. **Frontend Development**: A React-based interface to interact with the API and test predictions in real-time.

## üì∏ Usage Example
- Upload a CAPTCHA image via the interface.
- The API will process the image and return the model's prediction.
- The result will be displayed on the screen.

## üìñ License
This project is open-source under the MIT license.
